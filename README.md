# MssiahServices

##### A complete e-commerce website with stripe API integration. The website primarily uses Node.js for backend communication, coupled with MongoDB to store user details, orders and blog posts.
##### The frontend was done using pure Html and CSS with the usage of bootstrap for predefined container styles. MongoDB was the primary database used along with Node.js to keep track of API/ webpage requests. 
##### Dependencies such as EJS and passport where also used to essentially pass data around from frontend to the backend and to hash and salt passwords before saving it into the database.
